# FLIGHTS-reuploaded-
## This project involves the use of SQL queries to analyze flight delay data for American Airlines. The objective is to identify patterns and trends in flight delays, including factors influencing delays such as time of day, weather conditions, and flight routes. By querying a dataset containing historical flight records, including departure and arrival times, delay durations, and other relevant variables, we aim to generate insights into the frequency, duration, and causes of delays. This analysis will help in understanding operational inefficiencies and improving overall flight scheduling .
